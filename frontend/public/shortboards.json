        "description": "The rails are slightly more refined and performance oriented. The concave is the same under the front foot but splits into a subtle, double-barrel and V out the tail in the last 5‚Äù. I normally look for a round tail to provide smoothness in transition from rail to rail and during turns, but the squash tail is proving to not only have that quality as well, but also a bit more release in the turns."

We have added more rocker in the entry and exit for more hold through turns and drive. It's going to surf its best in small to medium waves and just like the Disco Inferno the Inferno 72 is a performance surfboard that will handle just about all conditions thrown at it and maintain its spark."

However, the one bit of feedback we kept hearing was that it was that it works best in waves shoulder-high and up, so we looked at making a step-down board that would bring that same feel to the head-high and under days that make up most of our daily surf sessions."
