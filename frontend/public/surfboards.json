The concave is the same under the front foot but splits into a subtle, double-barrel and V out the tail in the last 5‚Äù. I normally look for a round tail to provide smoothness in transition from rail to rail and during turns, but the squash tail is proving to not only have that quality as well, but also a bit more release in the turns."
